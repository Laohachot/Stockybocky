Interesting since it have shown impressive growth, but the price to book is still very modest. People are speculating of a correction, but I think this stock is good to go as I have seen way more "overhyped" stocks (i.e Context Vision, as it has a very high PB according to Yahoo (but not Nordneet and Bloomberg, weird)).
