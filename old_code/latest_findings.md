Ticker: PLT

Interesting since it have shown impressive growth, but the price to book is still very modest. People are speculating of a correction, but I think this stock is good to go as I have seen way more "overhyped" stocks (i.e Context Vision, as it has a very high PB according to Yahoo (but not Nordnet and Bloomberg, weird)). 

# CRAYON
Ticker: Crayon Group Holding

Very large worldwide IT company that has overall shown very good statistics and impressive growth. Partners with giants such a Microsoft, providing AI and Cloud services. High optimism overall, 60% collateral, incredible PE of 212, but still with a PB that is below the sector average.
